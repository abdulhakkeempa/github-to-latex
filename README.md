# GitHub to Latex

A beautiful web page has been crafted with the purpose of streamlining the tedious task of transforming code from my GitHub profile into a polished LaTeX laboratory record template. No longer do I have to waste precious time copying and pasting code, adding titles, and outlining the aim. This simple project saves me and my colleagues a significant amount of time, allowing us to focus on what truly matters.
